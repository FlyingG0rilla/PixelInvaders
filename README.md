# PixelInvaders
Space Invaders remake made for an school assignment in 2021


## Overview

This project was created as the final assignment for the school course **Computer Technik** by me and a classmate over a period of about two weeks.
The goal was to apply all learned Java concepts and programming skills by recreating an existing game in smal groups of two or three students.

The finished project was submitted and graded as a written final exam (*Klausur*).


## Features

- Classic Space Invaders gameplay
- Player-controlled spaceship with keyboard input (W/A/S/D + Space)
- Shooting mechanics with animated projectiles
- Randomized enemy shooting behavior
- Enemy wave spawning system that randomly spawns enemys at the top of the screen
- Player health system with visual heart indicators

- Collision detection for:
  - Player projectiles vs enemies
  - Enemy lasers vs player
  - Screen boundaries


## Tech Stack

- Language: Java
- GUI Framework: Java Swing (JFrame, JPanel)

>  **Note:** This project was created in 2021 as one of my first completed programming assignments.
> It was developed in collaboration with a classmate as part of a school course.
> Due to the age of the project, individual contributions are not tracked, and it is kept here to document my learning progress.
